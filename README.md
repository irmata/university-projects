## 📝 Overview

This repository contains a sample collection of some undergone group projects and assigned individual assignments (specifically **"Company Manager"** and **"Pokemon Game"**) completed as part of my university coursework. My contributions to the included codebases are significant, and I am able to provide detailed walkthroughs and explanations of the code artifacts upon request.

## ⚙️ Project Status and Setup Notes

Please note that most of the sub-repositories are **not runnable in their current form**, as they may lack certain configurations such as:

- Supplied environment variables
- Database credentials
- Necessary installations
- IDE-specific settings

This repository is intended primarily as a **demonstration of my familiarity** with various programming languages, workflows, and my ability to adopt relevant coding practices.

## 🧠 Code Quality and Learning Context

Regarding code quality, I acknowledge that some projects may not fully reflect best practices in maintainability or performance optimization. These limitations are largely due to the **original scope and constraints** of the associated coursework.

However, through rigorous participation in courses such as:

- **Software Design Analysis**
- **Software Quality**
- **Software Testing**

I have acquired the skills necessary to **critically assess, improve, and justify architectural and design choices** when necessity or request calls for it.

## 🤝 Academic Integrity and Consent

The presentation of these repositories is made **with the consent of former group members** and aligns with my university’s policy of encouraging students to **publicly share and showcase** their academic work.
